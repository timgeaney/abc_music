A comparison of how to implement playing ABC music notation using three different languages Python, Java and C#.

Python and C# allow you access to the console beep but Java, as far as I know, doesn't allow this so I accessed the 
computers speakers instead using StdAudio library.

The programs in C# and Java are done in an object oriented manner and are a few hundred lines each the program in
python which does pretty much exactly the same thing is about 15 lines...ahhhhemm!
